0.34 2014-05-20
 - Backcompat workaround so you can ship static/css and static/js and on
   4.0 we copy to html/NoAuth/{css,js}.  Isn't a full win for images which
   needed a dhandler hack under 4.0.

0.33 2014-03-17
 - Better error message when requires_rt dies
 - Release a pent up set of changes now that they've been tested

0.32_02 2014-02-10
 - Avoid some false positives that would offer a make upgrade-database
   which cannot work.

0.32_01 2014-01-10
 - Now that we aren't packaging extensions against 3.6, we can use
   cmp_versions imported from RT core rather than copy/paste.
 - new rt_too_new which allows you to bail out before being installed on a
   version of RT which is too new for you to function normally on
   (corollary to requires_rt).
 - requires_rt now dies if your RT is too old rather than just warning.

0.32 2013-09-06
 - new make upgrade-database command; this feature needs RT 4.2 or
   4.0.14+ for maximum benefit, and is used in the RTIR 3.0 release
   series

0.31 2013-04-08
 - Use the DatabaseAdmin configuration if supplied
 - Install /static/ on future 4.2 versions of RT

0.30 2012-11-06
 - remove a lot of old unused code
 - add support for a 4.1 feature that records database changes made by the
   extension

0.29_02 2012-08-16
 - further removal of make factory, this time 'make dropdb'

0.29_01 2012-08-16
 - Remove support for 'make factory'
 - Add support for a new 4.1 feature that records database changes made by
   the extension

0.29 2011-05-20
 - add requires_rt to handle requiring an RT version since MakeMaker and
   Module::Install::AutoInstall can't deal with RT version numbers.

0.28 2011-03-15
 - search /opt/rt4 for RT.pm

0.27 2010-12-16
 - Include RT's lib/ directory in INC so that requires() on RT::VERSION
   work properly

0.26 2010-12-14
 - Search RTHOME before searching @INC This works around distribution
   packages lurking in @INC

0.25 2009-10-08
 - Make prompt for lib path clearer [rt.cpan.org #50328
 - trim RT.pm from lib paths entered by users

0.24 2008-09-15
 - updated docs
 - die when target is RT 3.8.0
 - install libs only into one path, don't double-install them on RT 3.8.x
 - delete VERSION from POD, we just always forget to update it

0.23 2008-05-09
 - RT now respects the --datafile flag to rt-setup-database when used with
   --action acl or --action schema. Don't pass the initialdata file when
   we're doing schema changes

0.22 2008-03-25
 - Add local lib path to the @INC when we call any script that may load RT
   config.

0.21 2007-12-07
 - LICENSING CHANGE: This compilation and all individual files in it are
   now under the permissive "MIT" license.  See the COPYRIGHT section in
   README for the new terms.
 - Cleanup on POD, changelog, README, etc.
 - Bump dependency of Module::Install::Admin to 0.40, so we can make use of
   all_from() and drop the parentheses in Makefile.PL commands.

0.20 2007-12-05
 - Support for new RT 3.7 "RT Plugin" mechanism.
 - No longer tries to write to the global local perl man and site
   directories (packlists and manpages), instead installing them within the
   RT hierarchy.

0.11 2005-02-26
 - make initdb now prompts for dba password.

0.10 2004-09-09
 - "make initialize-database" added as an alias to "make initdb", for
   better consistency with core RT installation. Reported by: Sika.

0.09 2004-09-09
 - Moved under SVK management; remove all keyword expansion lines.
 - Corrected the use of $ENV{RTHOME} and documented it.

0.08 2004-05-31
 - "make initdb" now moved to M::I::RTx::Factory, so the person running
   "perl Makefile.PL" needs not have permission to read RT_SiteConfig.pm.
 - M::I::RTx::Factory now survives pod-stripping.
 - Jesse reports that RTx('RT-Foo-Bar') breaks.
 - Improve table detection in Pg.
 - Better handling failed require() on _Overlay classes in the factory.

0.07 2004-05-13
 - Need to use RT::LoadConfig instead of requiring the config files
   directly. Reported by: Jesse Vincent

0.06 2004-05-10
 - Support "make factory", "make initdb", "make dropdb" for extensions that
   has its own initialdata and schema.

0.05 2004-02-01
 - Now installs libs to $RT::LocalPath/lib instead of perl's sitelib.

   lib.
 - Allow overriding prefix with $ENV{PREFIX}

0.04 2004-01-10
 - Update copyright years.
 - Make var/ directory writable
 - Some people insist on doing "make initialize-database" before "make

 - Some POD cleanups.
