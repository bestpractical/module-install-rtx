NAME
    Module::Install::RTx - RT extension installer

SYNOPSIS
    In the Makefile.PL of the "RT-Extension-Example" module:

        use inc::Module::Install;
        RTx 'RT-Extension-Example';

        requires_rt '4.2.0';
        rt_too_new  '4.4.0';

        WriteAll();

DESCRIPTION
    This Module::Install extension implements several functions for
    installing RT extensions:

  RTx '*extension name*'
    This function arranges for the following directories to be installed, if
    they exist (assuming "RTx('RT-Extension-Example')"):

        ./bin    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/bin
        ./etc    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/etc
        ./html   => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/html
        ./lib    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/lib
        ./po     => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/po
        ./sbin   => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/sbin
        ./static => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/static
        ./var    => $RT::LocalPluginPath/RT-Extension-Example/var

    Accepts an optional argument hashref after the extension name with two
    possible keys

  deprecated_rt
        If set to a true value, skips the enforced RT-4.0.0 minimum version check

        You should set a perl_version if using this option and requires_rt(), because requires_rt
        only handles figuring our what perl you need if you're on RT 4.0.0 or higher.

  no_readme_generation
        If set to a true value, will not call readme_from on the extension's primary perl module.

  requires_rt *version*
    Takes one argument, a valid RT version. If an attempt is made to install
    on an RT than that version, it will die before Makefile creation.

  requires_rt_plugin *RT::Extension::Example* [, *version*]
    Ensures that the given RT extension (and optional version) is installed
    in the target RT instance; "requires" cannot be used because RT
    extensions are not in @INC.

  rt_too_new *version* [, *message*]
    Takes one argument, a valid RT version, and prevents this module from
    being installed on any version of RT equal to or newer than that. Useful
    if a particular release of an extension only works on 4.0.x but not
    4.2.x.

    Takes an optional second argument which allows you to specify a custom
    error message. This message is passed to sprintf with two string
    arguments, the current RT version and the version you specify.

CAVEATS
    *   Us the full name when calling RTx method in Makefile.PL; while
        "RTx('Foo')" was once supported, it is no longer.

ENVIRONMENT
    RTHOME
        Path to the RT installation that contains a valid lib/RT.pm.
