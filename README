NAME
    Module::Install::RTx - RT extension installer

SYNOPSIS
    In the Makefile.PL of the "RT-Extension-Foo" module:

        use inc::Module::Install;
        RTx 'RT-Extension-Foo';
        WriteAll();

    optionally add a

        requires_rt('3.8.9');

    to die if your RT version is too old during install

DESCRIPTION
    This Module::Install extension implements a function, "RTx", that takes
    the extension name as the only argument.

    It arranges for certain subdirectories to install into the installed RT
    location, but does not affect the usual "lib" and "t" directories.

    The directory mapping table is as below:

        ./bin   => $RT::LocalPath/bin
        ./etc   => $RT::LocalPath/etc/$NAME
        ./html  => $RT::MasonComponentRoot
        ./po    => $RT::LocalLexiconPath/$NAME
        ./sbin  => $RT::LocalPath/sbin
        ./var   => $RT::VarPath/$NAME

    Under the default RT3 layout in /opt and with the extension name "Foo",
    it becomes:

        ./bin   => /opt/rt3/local/bin
        ./etc   => /opt/rt3/local/etc/Foo
        ./html  => /opt/rt3/share/html
        ./po    => /opt/rt3/local/po/Foo
        ./sbin  => /opt/rt3/local/sbin
        ./var   => /opt/rt3/var/Foo

    By default, all these subdirectories will be installed with "make
    install". you can override this by setting the "WITH_SUBDIRS"
    environment variable to a comma-delimited subdirectory list, such as
    "html,sbin".

    Alternatively, you can also specify the list as a command-line option to
    "Makefile.PL", like this:

        perl Makefile.PL WITH_SUBDIRS=sbin

    This module also provides the following helper functions

  requires_rt
    Takes one argument, a valid RT version. If an attempt is made to install
    on an older RT, it will die before Makefile creation.

  rt_too_new
    Takes an RT version and prevents this module from being installed on any
    version of RT equal to or newer than that. Useful if a particular
    release of an extension only works on 4.0.x but not 4.2.x.

    Takes an optional second argument which allows you to specify a custom
    error message. This message is passed to sprintf with two string
    arguments, the current RT version and the version you specify.

CAVEATS
    *   Use full name when call RTx method in Makefile.PL, some magic has
        been implemented in this installer to support RTx('Foo') for
        'RTx-Foo' extension, but life proved that it's bad idea. Code still
        there for backwards compatibility. It will be deleted eventually.

    *   installer won't work with RT 3.8.0, as it has some bugs new plugins
        sub-system.

    *   layout of files has been changed between RT 3.6 and RT 3.8, old
        files may influence behaviour of your extension. Recommend people
        use clean dir on upgrade or guide how to remove old versions of your
        extension.

ENVIRONMENT
    RTHOME
        Path to the RT installation that contains a valid lib/RT.pm.
